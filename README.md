# Revised-SEO-Advertising-Page

## Description

The goal with this project was to revising exisiting code to meet accesibility guidlines by adding alt text to images as well as cleaning up the CSS sheet. Many of the selectors were updated from generic div elements to semantic selectors as well as having redunt selectors removed and their functionality combined by creating classes that encompassed all the elements.

As a result, the page should be more user friendly if being viewed using a screen reader, as well as easier to understand and edit in the future as the selectors are now clearer and the CSS sheet has been commented to describe the functionality.
